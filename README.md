<br>
<p align="center">This game is called "The Pig Game". 
<br>
The goal of the game is to reach 100 points first than the other player through the roll of the dice.
<br>
Be careful, the score keeps adding through every roll, but decreases to zero if you have rolled a 1 and it switches the turn to the other player. So, if you feel lucky roll the dice until you feel is a nice score and "Hold" your score, next, it's the turn of the other player!
<br> 
"New Game" Is to reset the scores of both players and starts the game with player 1.
